## Introduction:
This team project is to reproduce a simplified version of the classic strategy game RISK.  
For the simple version of RISK, we skip the initial phase where players take turns to choose countries and place armies. Instead, we start will a random map which the countires and armies are already set up for players.Also, this project skip the phase of drawing cards and using them to receive more armies.

### Milestone 1:
A text-based playable version of the game, the players could use console to play the game. The console can print out the state of the map,for example:The outcome of an attack, whose turn it is to play, the elimination of a player, etc.   
â€¢ Deliverables:   
readme file   
code (source + executable in a jar file)   
UML diagrams   
documentation.
